# Scamp library

from scamo import Session

add a midi part and add a IAC bus
first try playing random notes in  while loop where you generate on every iteration
Next, you can use MarkovModel to generate
Next, you can use cellular automata where the life of a cell describes which 808 beat is played

# MIR

## Fundamentals of MIR
Most famous rule of cellular automata - Wolfram Rule 30

with the kick he used rule 30 because it is the spine of the beat which is going to be generated with cellular automata

STFT
Short Time Fourier Transform

breaking up the time analysis of frequesncies and checking fourier transforms helps us understand the change in frequesncies. To do this a little faster we can just use STFT.

Linear Frequency Scale vs. Mel Scale

Higher resolution of perception in lower frequencies and the other way around for us humans. WE use mel scale to understand how humans percive this.

Non linear mapping in terms of a DB scale (need more context)

In a spectrogram, when data is spread across horizontally, there is more harmonic context, vertically means that there is more melodic content.

## Audio Mosaics

Making Guitar sound like Violin

Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
Sparse Coding

(timbre transfer)

PCA can be considered to be a probabilistic form of NMF
